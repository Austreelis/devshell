# devshell - a shared developer shell

**STATUS: unstable**

The goal of this project is to simplify per-project developer environments.

Imagine, a new employee joins the company, or somebody transfers teams, or
somebody wants to contribute to one of your Open Source projects. It
should take them 10 minutes to clone the repo and get all of the development
dependencies.

We have a CLI, `devshell`, a TOML file, [devshell.toml](devshell.toml.md) and
some supporting Nix code.
