# Getting started

This project has a single dependency; Nix. It will be used to pull in all
other dependencies. It can be installed by following the instructions
over there: https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-quick-install

Now that's done, got to your project root and create an empty `devshell.toml`.

There are different ways to load that config depending on your preferences:

Add another file called `shell.nix` with the following content. This file will
contain some nix code. Don't worry about the details.

```nix
{ system ? builtins.currentSystem }:
let
  src = fetchTarball "https://github.com/numtide/devshell/archive/master.tar.gz"
  devshell = import src { inherit system; };
in
devshell.fromTOML ./devshell.toml
```

Now you can enter the developer shell for the project:

```console
$ nix-shell
warning: you did not specify '--add-root'; the result might be removed by the garbage collector
these 4 derivations will be built:
